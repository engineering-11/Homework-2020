    "* The source is assumed to be in the center of the body and the attenuation of gamma radiation is determined using the assumption that the body is a sphere of water:\n",
    "  * $e^{-\\mu r}$ = 0.48\n",
    "  * where $\\mu = 0.036/cm$ and $r = 20cm$\n",
    "  * Therefore, all gamma radiation sources inside the body should include a multiplicative factor of $0.48$ when determining the absorbed or effective dose.\n",
